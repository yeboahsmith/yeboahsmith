### ðŸš€ About Me
```html
ðŸ’¡ I'm a Backend Developer-in-Training enrolled in the rigorous ALX Software Engineering Program.

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to become a professional Software Engineer who can:
  â€¢ Design & build scalable backend systems
  â€¢ Own a project from start to finish
  â€¢ Deliver real-world solutions that solve problems

ðŸ”¥ I'm passionate about coding, APIs, problem solving, and building things that work. I'm motivated by progress and excited about every chance to create or collaborate on a new idea.
